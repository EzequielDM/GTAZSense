## Features

Below is an incomplete list of feature that I believe are notable to this "base" or menu.

 - Return Native spoofing
 - Custom [settings](BigBaseV2/src/core/globals.hpp) with deep compare if changes were made include auto saving
 - Clear and well structured source code
 - Includes a thread pool to queue tasks that shouldn't block the game thread, very similar to fiber pool
 - Updated natives.hpp from https://nativedb.pieceof.art/natives
 - Includes basic code samples to interact with an api
 - ReClass.NET structures implemented, accessible from a global called g_local_player defined in `common.hpp`
 - Recovery methods for gaining some good cash $$$$
 - Trolling methods including player kick and crash
 - More protection options to prevent crashes and kicks even from the most expensive P2C
