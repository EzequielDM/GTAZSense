## Features

Below is an incomplete list of feature that I believe are notable to this "base" or menu.

 - Return Native spoofing
 - Custom [settings](BigBaseV2/src/core/globals.hpp) with deep compare if changes were made include auto saving
 - Clear and well structured source code
 - Includes a thread pool to queue tasks that shouldn't block the game thread, very similar to fiber pool
 - Updated natives.hpp from https://nativedb.pieceof.art/natives
 - Includes basic code samples to interact with an api
 - ReClass.NET structures implemented, accessible from a global called g_local_player defined in `common.hpp`
 - Recovery methods for gaining some good cash $$$$
 - Trolling methods including player kick and crash
 - More protection options to prevent crashes and kickes even from the most expensive P2C

## Contributing

Welcome to the development team first of all, the rules are simple, clean code and high performance.
You're free to make branches with your name as a prefix and whatever you're implementing after it.

**Example:** edeen-auto-ceo-crates

Which would mean that edeen (big bald man) is developing something related to automating CEO crates or something along those lines, be descriptive but not long, keywords are... key...

Any questions you can just ask me ([@EzequielDM](https://github.com/EzequielDM)) directly.
